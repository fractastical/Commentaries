The Bhagavad Gita, while often considered a philosophical work, is also a classic in a literary sense. The work, which consists of conversations between the warrior Arjuna and his mentor, the avatar of Visnhu Krishna,  frequently has no discernerable organization. 

Some significant framing is, however, provided at the outset. The first chapter (or book) presents the inner conflict Arjuna who, arranged in fighting order against his relatives, perceives it as an extreme violation of the family duty (dharma) for him to fight against his kin and states his greater desire to die than to lift up his hand against his relatives. His primary concerns are “conservative” in a classical sense. He is concerned first and foremost about lawlessness that takes place when familial duty is abrogated, including things like intermixture between castes and the lack of performance of the appropriate offerings to the ancestors. 

The logic is something like as follows: if Arjuna takes up his hand against his relatives, this would be an abrogation of familial duty (kuladharma_n.a_m) and caste duty (ja_tidharmas), which is one step on a slippery slope that leads to such obviously terrible things as racial intermixture and the cessation of ancestral offerings. Significant is also that the duties or laws attendent to the family and caste are presented as eternal (“s’a’svatas).  

That these things are stated without justification indicates that they must have been common concerns of the early audience of this text.
